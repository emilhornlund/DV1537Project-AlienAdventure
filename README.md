# DV1537Project-AlienAdventure
My ambition was to write a simple side-scrolling game as a project in one of my early c++ courses at Blekinge Institute of Technology back in 2016.

It uses SFML, is solely written in c++11 and builds using cmake.

**Some of the project requirements**
- The program should be composed of 5-10 custom classes.
- File management (read from and write to file) should be included (if applicable).
- Inheritance should be included (if relevant).
- The project should use SFML for the graphic part if you are doing a moving graphics game and Qt if you are doing a GUI application.
- The result should be a well-functioning and well-documented application / game based on object-oriented principles.

*I may have over-killed it :)*
